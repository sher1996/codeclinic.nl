- **Default Password**: `admin123`
- **Change Password**: To change the password, edit the `ADMIN_PASSWORD` constant in `components/HiddenAdminAccess.tsx`

## API Endpoints

The admin system uses these API endpoints:

- `GET /api/calendar` - Get all bookings
- `PUT /api/calendar/[id]` - Update a specific booking
- `DELETE /api/calendar/[id]` - Delete a specific booking
- `POST /api/calendar/clear` - Clear all bookings

## Tips for Administrators

1. **Remember the Shortcuts**: Keep the keyboard shortcut (`Ctrl + Alt + A`) handy
2. **Regular Monitoring**: Check the Statistics tab regularly to monitor booking patterns
3. **Backup**: Consider backing up booking data before major operations
4. **Communication**: When editing bookings, consider notifying customers of changes
5. **Time Slots**: Popular time slots can help you optimize your schedule
6. **Notes**: Use the notes field to add important information about bookings

## Troubleshooting

### Can't Access Admin Panel?
- Try all three access methods (keyboard shortcut, typing "admin", URL parameter)
- Make sure you're typing "admin" while the page is focused
- Verify you're using the correct password
- Check that JavaScript is enabled in your browser

### Bookings Not Loading?
- Check your internet connection
- Refresh the page and try again
- Check the browser console for error messages

### Can't Edit/Delete Bookings?
- Make sure you're logged in as admin
- Check that the booking exists
- Try refreshing the page

## Customization

### Changing the Admin Password
Edit the `ADMIN_PASSWORD` constant in `components/HiddenAdminAccess.tsx`:
```typescript
const ADMIN_PASSWORD = 'your-new-password';
```

### Changing the Keyboard Shortcut
Edit the keyboard event handler in `components/HiddenAdminAccess.tsx`:
```typescript
// Change from Ctrl + Alt + A to your preferred combination
if (event.ctrlKey && event.altKey && event.key === 'a') {
  // Your custom shortcut
}
```

### Modifying Time Slots
Edit the time slot generation in `app/api/calendar/route.ts`:
```typescript
function generateTimeSlots(): string[] {
  const slots: string[] = [];
  for (let h = 9; h <= 16; h++) { // Change 9 and 16 to adjust hours
    slots.push(`${String(h).padStart(2, '0')}:00`);
    slots.push(`${String(h).padStart(2, '0')}:30`);
  }
  return slots;
}
```

### Styling Changes
The admin interface uses Tailwind CSS classes. You can modify the styling in the respective component files.

## Security Notes

- The admin access is completely hidden from regular users
- Only those who know the secret methods can access the admin panel
- Consider changing the default password for production use
- The keyboard shortcut and typing method work on any page of the website
